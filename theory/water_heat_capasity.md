### Specific heat capasity of water:

The specific heat capacity of a substance, denoted by c , is the heat capacity C of a sample of the substance, divided by the mass M of the sample:

the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 K is 4184 joules, so the specific heat capacity of water is $4184\,J\;kg^{−1}K^{−1}$. 

$1\;J = 6,242×10^{12}\;MeV$ meaning that in $MeV$ the specific heat capacity of water is $2.6114 \times 10^{16} MeV\;kg^{−1}K^{−1}$
