### Specific heat capasity of water:

The specific heat capacity of a substance, denoted by c , is the heat capacity C of a sample of the substance, divided by the mass M of the sample:

the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 K is 4184 joules, so the specific heat capacity of water is $4184\,J\;kg^{−1}K^{−1}$. 

$1\;J = 6,242×10^{12}\;MeV$ meaning that in $MeV$ the specific heat capacity of water is $2.6114 \times 10^{16} MeV\;kg^{−1}K^{−1}$
$\;\\\;$

$$\frac{m_1T_1 + m_2T_2}{m_1+m_2}$$

$$flow = \alpha\;kg/s\\\;\\
T(t) = \frac{(m_1-\alpha t)T_1 + \alpha t\; T_2 }{(m_1-\alpha t) + \alpha t}$$ 

Only one mass simplifies to:
$$
T(t) = \frac{(m-\alpha t)T_1 + \alpha t T_2 }{m}\\\:\\
= \frac{1}{m}\;mT_1 - \alpha t T_1 + \alpha t T_2\\\:\\
= \frac{1}{m}\;mT_1 + \alpha t(T_2 - T_1)$$

Differenciate with regards to t:

$$T'_t = \alpha(T_2 - T_1)$$
